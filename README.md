# TicTacToe

This is a working TicTacToe game in JavaScript.
It was created as small school Project by my self to get in Java Script and learn it!

It has 3 different "game modes":

- 2 player mode
- Easy opponent
- Good opponent


## __2 player mode:__

- Two players can take turns clicking on the fields and playing against lonelier players.

## __Simple opponent:__

- You play alone against random numbers. The chance of winning is very high.
So you always take random fields from your opponent :D

## __Good opponent:__

- The good opponent recognizes when you almost finish a row and tries to stop you


## __Attention!

The code may contain errors!

Have fun with it! :D
